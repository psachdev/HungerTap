# HungerTap
HungerTap is an Android application that is aimed to allow users with smartphones to order their food at a fast food joint or coffee shop in a quick and effective way without standing in any lines. The HungerTap app has two versions. One version caters to users with NFC enabled smartphones and another version caters to users whose phones are not NFC enabled. Hence the app can have a large user base. An admin app of HungerTap would enable restaurant owners to create custom made menu boards with NFC chips or QR codes or both. Customers with the hunger tap app scan or tap items on the menu board that they wish to order. Customers have the option to pay immediately using PayPal or pay later at the counter by cash/card. They are provided the status of their orders to figure out when it is ready for pickup. In this way customers do not have to wait in line just to order their food and restaurants can use their staff to prepare orders. Faster service would mean happier customers and also increased loyalty which would lead to increased profits.
